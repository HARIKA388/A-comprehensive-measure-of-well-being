# Epic 6: Fitting the Model

## Project Title

**A Comprehensive Measure of Well-Being**

---

## Overview

This phase focuses on building and evaluating the machine learning model for predicting the Human Development Index (HDI). A **Linear Regression** algorithm is trained using the prepared training dataset, and the trained model is then used to predict HDI scores for unseen testing data. This step helps determine how well the model has learned the relationship between the selected socio-economic indicators and the target variable.

---

## Objectives

* Train a Linear Regression model using the training dataset.
* Learn the relationship between input features and the HDI score.
* Generate predictions for the testing dataset.
* Evaluate the prediction performance using regression metrics.

---

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Fit the Linear Regression Model

The Linear Regression algorithm was selected because the target variable (HDI Score) is continuous. The model was trained using the training dataset to learn the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

**Input Features:**

* Life Expectancy
* Mean Years of Schooling
* Expected Years of Schooling
* Gross National Income (GNI) Per Capita

**Target Variable:**

* HDI Score

The trained model is capable of estimating HDI values for new datasets.

### 2. Predicting the Results

After training, the model was tested using the testing dataset.

The following activities were performed:

* Generated HDI predictions using the trained model.
* Compared predicted values with actual values.
* Evaluated the model using regression metrics.

**Evaluation Metrics:**

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

These metrics help determine the prediction accuracy and reliability of the model.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn

## Workflow

1. Import the Linear Regression algorithm.
2. Train the model using the training dataset.
3. Generate predictions for the testing dataset.
4. Evaluate prediction performance using regression metrics.
5. Prepare the trained model for deployment.

---

## Outcome

The Linear Regression model was successfully trained and evaluated. It accurately learned the relationship between the selected socio-economic indicators and the Human Development Index (HDI), producing reliable predictions for unseen data. The trained model is now ready to be saved and integrated into the Flask web application for real-time HDI prediction.

---

## Next Step

The next phase is **Epic 7: Saving the Model**, where the trained Linear Regression model will be serialized and stored as a `.pkl` file for deployment in the Flask web application.
