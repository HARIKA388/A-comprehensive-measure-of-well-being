# Epic 4: Data Preprocessing and Label Encoding

## Project Title

**A Comprehensive Measure of Well-Being**

---

## Overview

This module focuses on preparing the Human Development Index (HDI) dataset for machine learning by performing essential data preprocessing tasks. The objective is to ensure that the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for model training. The preprocessing includes selecting the appropriate input and output variables, checking for missing values, and handling null values where necessary.

---

## Objectives

* Select the independent (feature) variables.
* Select the dependent (target) variable.
* Check the dataset for missing (null) values.
* Handle missing values using an appropriate preprocessing technique.
* Prepare the dataset for the train-test split and model development.

---

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Selecting Dependent and Independent Variables

The dataset contains several socio-economic indicators that influence the Human Development Index (HDI). Appropriate features were selected to train the machine learning model.

#### Independent Variables (Features)

* Life Expectancy
* Mean Years of Schooling
* Expected Years of Schooling
* Gross National Income (GNI) Per Capita

#### Dependent Variable (Target)

* HDI Score

These selected variables represent the key dimensions of human development, including health, education, and standard of living.

### 2. Checking and Handling Null Values

The dataset was examined for missing or null values to ensure data quality before model training.

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

* Checked each column for missing values.
* Identified incomplete records, if any.
* Replaced missing numerical values using mean imputation.
* Verified that the dataset was clean and complete.

This preprocessing step improves the reliability and accuracy of the machine learning model.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn

## Project Workflow

1. Load the HDI dataset.
2. Select independent and dependent variables.
3. Check for missing values.
4. Handle null values using mean imputation.
5. Prepare the cleaned dataset for train-test splitting.
6. Continue with machine learning model development.

---

## Outcome

The Human Development Index dataset was successfully preprocessed by selecting the appropriate input and output variables and handling missing values. The resulting dataset is clean, well-structured, and ready for model training and evaluation using Linear Regression.

---

## Next Step

The preprocessed dataset will be used in the next phase:

**Epic 5: Dividing the Model into Train and Test Data**, where the dataset will be split into training and testing sets for building and evaluating the predictive model.
