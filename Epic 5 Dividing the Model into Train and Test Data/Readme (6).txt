# Epic 5: Train and Test Data

## Project Title

**A Comprehensive Measure of Well-Being**

---

## Overview

This task focuses on splitting the Human Development Index (HDI) dataset into training and testing datasets. This is a crucial preprocessing step that allows the machine learning model to learn from historical data and be evaluated using unseen data to measure its predictive performance.

---

## Objective

* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Prepare the data for Linear Regression model training.
* Ensure unbiased model evaluation.

---

## Method Used

The dataset is divided using Scikit-learn's `train_test_split()` function.

### Split Ratio

* **Training Data:** 80%
* **Testing Data:** 20%

### Python Library

* Scikit-learn (`train_test_split`)

---

## Code Used

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X,
    y,
    test_size=0.2,
    random_state=42
)
```

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn

## Outcome

The dataset was successfully divided into training and testing sets using an 80:20 ratio. The training dataset will be used to build the Linear Regression model, while the testing dataset will be used to evaluate the model's prediction performance.

---

## Next Step

The prepared training dataset will be used in **Epic 6: Fitting the Model**, where the Linear Regression algorithm will be trained and used to predict Human Development Index (HDI) scores.
