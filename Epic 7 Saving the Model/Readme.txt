# Epic 7: Saving the Model

## Project Title

**A Comprehensive Measure of Well-Being**

---

## Overview

This task focuses on saving the trained Linear Regression model after successful training and evaluation. The model is serialized using Python's Pickle module and stored as a `.pkl` file, allowing it to be reused for future predictions without retraining.

---

## Objective

* Save the trained machine learning model.
* Serialize the model using the Pickle module.
* Prepare the model for deployment in the Flask web application.
* Enable fast and efficient predictions.

---

## Tasks Completed

### Saving the Model

The trained Linear Regression model was serialized using Python's Pickle library.

The saved model file:

```text
models/hdi_model.pkl
```

### Loading the Model

The serialized model can be loaded whenever predictions are required, eliminating the need to retrain the model.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pickle

---

## Files Included

```text

Saving_the_Model_DOCUMENTATION.md
models/
└── hdi_model.pkl
```

---

## Benefits

* Faster application startup.
* No retraining required.
* Consistent prediction results.
* Easy deployment with Flask.
* Efficient model reuse.

---

## Outcome

The trained Linear Regression model was successfully saved as a Pickle (`.pkl`) file. The serialized model is now ready to be loaded by the Flask application, enabling real-time Human Development Index (HDI) predictions while reducing computational overhead and improving deployment efficiency.

---

## Next Step

The next phase is **Epic 8: Building the Flask Web Application**, where the saved model will be integrated into a Flask backend to provide an interactive web interface for HDI prediction.
